this is my first file made with git and edited in vs code all while using WSL ubuntu for windows im in a slow process of understanding how to use and navigate in the terminal but its fun and good brain food not too bad for someone that dropped out of school at 15 years old. also i havnt had much experience in coding or any software ive learned things on the way through gaming and mucking around with code but git is my focus so far for doing the odin project course. no coding yet but i know some basic things about it very very! basic 
im getting the hang of the basics for git so cool i feel like a wizard already.

my grammar and spelling is horrible
